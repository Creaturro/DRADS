    {
      "question": "Can you really build all apps in just 2 months?",
      "answer": "We’re not magicians, we won’t build a Facebook clone in 2 months, but... we have a pretty good grasp on how fast we can go. The key is to build initial specifications that are precise enough that we can hit that eight-week milestone. We aim to have production-ready code in this timeframe. Sometimes that’s the full app, sometimes it’s a practical piece that starts bringing you value while we work on other parts. Think of it as building a house - we’ll get you a comfy living room to relax in while we’re still working on that fancy home theater room."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the billing options with the apps?",
      "answer": "You can pay per billable hour, opt for a fixed app fee, or we can whip up a hybrid approach. It’s heavily app-dependent and can also be tailored to your personal preference."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there ongoing costs after you’ve built my app?",
      "answer": "Yes, in practice, it’s somewhere around $100-$150/month, depending on your app’s type and usage patterns. It can go higher if your app is chatty with external services or its popularity explodes."
    },
    {
      "question": "I’ve got a rough idea but I’m no app wizard. Can you help me out?",
      "answer": "YES! Let’s talk. We’re part developers, part mind readers. We’ll build the full work specifications with you, divide the work into bite-sized milestones, and help you ask the right questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of support do you offer?",
      "answer": "We’re in it for the long haul. We offer full training, bug fixes, new features. You can start small and grow, or start larger and grow bigger. We’re like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but for app support."
    },
    {
      "question": "How customizable are the apps you build?",
      "answer": "We’re not in the business of one-size-fits-all solutions. Our apps are built from the ground up to meet your specific needs. Whether you need a simple tool or a complex system, we’ll tailor it to fit your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate the app with my existing systems?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Whether you’re using Quickbooks, Hubspot, Mailchimp or some obscure system from the 90s, we’ll find a way to make them all sing in harmony."
    },
    {
      "question": "How involved do I need to be in the development process?",
      "answer": "As involved as you want to be! Some clients like to be in the passenger seat, offering direction at every turn. Others prefer to kick back in the back seat and enjoy the ride. We’re flexible – you can be as hands-on or hands-off as you like. Just remember, it’s your app baby, and we’re here to help you raise it right!"
